I worked in *Practical Data Mining & Exploration Lab* and *Assured Information Management and Sharing Lab*  at Emory University, Department of Computer Science, under the supervison of *Dr. Joyce Ho* and *Dr. Li Xiong* . My research interests include *Infectious disease modeling*, *Machine Learning*, *Healthcare Informatics*, *Probabilistic Graphical Models*, *Noisy Labelling*, *Crowdsourcing* and many other stuff health related! Outside academia, I enjoy running, music, board games, and learning about Psychoanalysis and Neuroscience. 

Research Objective

Conducting healthcare informatics research deployable in the real world to ensure maximal benefit for a broader population in society especially for reducing social and healthcare disparities across minority groups. Deepening my grasp of theoretical machine learning while exploring practical considerations and nuances of turning research into public policy.
